<p>Ever since the dawn of democracies, political scientists have been searching for the fundamental axes that best define our political beliefs. Are you progressive or conservative? Authoritarian or liberal? Do you favour small or big government? In order to represent such divisions, graphical representations known as “political compasses” have been created, which show where different people lie according to a set of questions that are believed to best characterise the political debate and capture the orientation of an individual.</p>

<p>Traditionally, all these compasses are built using 2 axis: a horizontal left-right econonomic scale, and a vertical authoritarian-libertarian social scale. But do these axes really define accurately the political divide of today, when political affiliations are shifting and traditional sticking points no longer hold?</p>

<p>To find it out, we analyze <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/4277311">Quotebank</a>, a dataset of ~180 milion quotations extracted from english news articles published between 2008 and 2020. Let’s begin our journey!
<!--Here we could add some example e.g. Conservatives in the UK raising taxes and giving out a lot of welfare when they were always a small-state party; democrats getting support from college-educated americans despite traditionally being a party of the working class (same with labour in the UK); rise of non-traditional parties such as En Marche in France or various parties (northern league, 5* movement) in Italy that have largely replaced the traditionally dominant christian democrats;etc--></p>

<h2 id="what-dominates-the-political-debate">What dominates the political debate?</h2>

<p>For simplicity, we decided to focus only on quotes attributed to alive American politicians, published between 2015 and 2020. We decided to focus only on the US to reduce the impact of local, country-specific topics, and to have a well-known framework of investigation as the US political system is. After filtering with said criteria, we are left with 9.5 million quotes from 14’000 different speakers. <!--Maybe add a comment about why 14k is ok because it sounds like a LOT--> Let’s now have a look at what it is that these politicians talk about – but before we do, let’s see who they are!</p>

<h3 id="the-silent-majority">The Silent Majority</h3>

<p>Looking at the politicians with the most quotes, we can see evidence of what statisticians call a “power law” (commonly also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80-20 rule</a>): few most quoted politicians completely dominate the debate, in spite of all the others. The most quoted politician, Donald Trump, accounts alone for almost 8% of all the quotes. To understand just how dominant that is, consider that if the quotes were uniformly distributed among our 14k politicians, an average politician should only account for 0.007% of the quotes! Indeed, our data even trump the 80-20 rule, as the top 20% of politicians account for almost 88% of the quotes. This shows that, in today’s world, few of the loudest politicians occupy the vast majority of media coverage, while the greatest part of politicians are given very little attention. Hence, we are seeing confirmation of the existence of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_majority">silent majority</a> that does not express its views publicly, or does so with little to no coverage.</p>

<p><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=Placeholder+Image" alt="Quote distribution shows strong dominance of loudest politicians" title="Loudest policitians dominate debate" /></p>

<h3 id="dominant-topics">Dominant Topics</h3>

<p>Having examined the politicians behind the quotes, let’s now investigate their content. To do so we use a tool called <a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html">BERTopic</a>, which allows us to learn and extract the topics that best characterise our quotes, leading us to the top 1000 significant topics <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Of course, 1000 topics is a bit too many to interpret and to create a political compass, so we will need to reduce this down further. Before we do, let’s get some insights about what the most significant topics are!</p>

<!-- some kind of plot? -->

<!--To do this, we look at the quotes that BERTopic finds as best representatives of the topics it found.-->
<p>Amongst the 10 topics with most quotes, many are uncannily familiar: Hillary Clinton, Iran, Womens’ Rights, Taxation or Youth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>– <cite> We have to tell young people that it does matter, every vote counts!</cite></p>

  <p>Most representative quote for the “Youth” topic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These topics are the ones which are most talked about, but are they also most divisive? Let’s find out!</p>

<h3 id="divisive-topics">Divisive Topics</h3>

<p>To analyze which topics divide politicians, we first need to get their sentiment towards each topic. For example, do they feel positive or negative towards Hillary Clinton or Womens’ Rights? To do this, we used Vader, a tool which assigns a number from -1 (negative sentiment) through 0 (neutral sentiment) to 1 (positive sentiment) to each individual quote. This allowed us to get the sentiment of each politician for each topic <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Then, we focused on the republican/democratic divide. On which topics do their sentiments differ the most?</p>

<p><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=Placeholder+Image" alt="Most divisive topics are transitory culture-war issues" title="Most divisive topics" /></p>

<p>The analysis shows that most divisive topics are in fact not topics of long-term vision for the country but rather those relating to transient issues that we could label as part of “culture wars” – they are related to particular people who polarized the public debate such as Mike Pompeo and Mike Pence or former FBI director Jim Comey. Interestingly, a topic about former president Donald Trump is not present. The only long-term topic out of the most divisive ones is the ‘Rejection of Paris accord’ which unsurprisingly triggered positive sentiments from republicans. Another interesting finding is that 2 out of the top 10 most divisive topics are Trump-appointed Supreme Court Justices, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, showing the politicization of the Supreme Court which has become a powerful player in a country with blocked legislature.
<!--{'920': 'Mike Pompeo','380': 'Mike Pence','558': 'Judge Neil Gorsuch','680': 'John Bolton','143': 'Kavanaugh family','208': 'FBI and Jim Comey','360': 'FISC, Adam Schiff','566': 'Rejection of Paris accord','615': 'Marco Rubio','841': 'Pittsburgh shooting'}--></p>

<h2 id="new-political-compass">New Political Compass</h2>

<p>Our analyses of 1000 topics yielded interesting results, but clearly having 1000 topics is not exactly practical for a political compass! That is why as the next step, we extracted the 3 most important axes of division which consist of a combination of the above topics that best describes the divide between democrats and republicans <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Few politicians completely dominate the public debate – <strong>silent majority</strong> phenomenom does exist!</li>
  <li>Topics politicians most talk about are not the ones where they most disagree – contrary to popular opinion, they agree on many issues!</li>
  <li>Topics that most divide politicians are mostly “culture wars” ephemeral topics that have little to do with a greater vision for the country.</li>
</ul>

      <p>Due to technical limitations, we used only a subset of 600k quotes for learning the topics, assigning then a topic to the remaining quotes with the fitted model. Also, BERTopic initially extracted more than 3000 topics, where each topic was extremely narrow and provided little interpretation possibilities. Hence, the topics were later hierarchically merged to reduce them to the 1000 we employed in the rest of the analysis. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>In particular, we did this as follows: first we assigned a sentiment to all the quotes. Then, for each politician, we averaged the sentiment of their quotes to each topic. We then removed politicians with less than 1000 quotes as a lower number than that did not give us sufficient representation of their opinions. If politicians did not express an opinion towards a topic, we left their sentiment as NaN, eventually replacing it with 0 for some further processing. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>This approach has some clear shortcomings – by maximizing the difference between republicans and democrats, we are not taking into account the clear differences that exist within the parties. This applies especially to the democratic party which is particularly fragmented: centrists like Joe Manchin have little in common of with extreme progressives like Alexandria Occasio Cortez. However, out of several dimensionality reduction techniques we have tried, this supervised method (NCA) gave the best results. We also tried using PCA, TNSE, and UMAP, all unsupervised techniques, but they seemed to focus more on the number of quotes people have rather than their political opinion. This is most likely because despite the fact that we did not explicitly include number of quotes, more quoted politicians expressed a sentiment towards more topics, and they were clustered together in the reduced space as a result. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
